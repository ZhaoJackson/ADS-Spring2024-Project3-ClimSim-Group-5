### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project 3

Team members: Kexin Liang, Zichen Zhao, Zhengfei Chen, Guanbiao Li

Summary: In this project, we developed a CNN for model 1 and VGG16 for model and improved the classification accuracy for images to 85%.

[Contribution Statement] Kexin Liang, Zichen Zhao, Zhengfei Chen and Guanbiao Li designed the study. Guanbiao Li and Zhengfei Chen developed CNN classification model 1. Guanbiao Li explored feature engineering for improving the CNN model 1. Kexin Liang and Zichen Zhao developed VGG16 classification model 2. All four of the project members discussed and designed the model evaluation protocol. Zhengfei Chen and Zichen Zhao carried out the computation for model evaluation. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
